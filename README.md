# Café-Cosmo-Menu

*Taste the cosmos... one flip at a time.*

Welcome to **Café-Cosmo-Menu**, the only digital menu with a flair for the dramatic. Why have one static menu when you can have a whole galaxy of cards flipping in perfect, synchronized harmony? Conceived from a moment of profound hunger, this project answers the question nobody asked: "What if my menu had more dimensions than my food?"

## How It Works

The goal is beautifully simple: to show you delicious food. But the execution is where the cosmic madness lies.

* **The Card Grid:** Each item is a celestial body, contained within a 280x360px card.
* **The Flip:** Every card has a front (the tantalizing image) and a back (the cosmic description) that flips into view on hover. It's like a tiny, well-rehearsed culinary performance, but for ordering lunch.
* **The Brains:** A slick CSS engine calculates the correct perspective and transform properties for each card based on your mouse position and updates them in real-time.

## Features

* **Shows Food & Drinks:** Shockingly, yes. It accurately displays coffees and sandwiches.
* **Mesmerizing Animation:** The cards transition smoothly, creating a visual spectacle with every passing hover.
* **Intricate Card Design:** The descriptions on the back of each card are a work of art, proving that even something as mundane as a menu can be beautiful.
* **Fully Customizable:** Built with standard HTML and CSS, you can tweak, style, and modify it to your heart's content. Go ahead, make the sandwiches shaped like starships. We won't judge.

## Developer Info

This temporal masterpiece was inspired by a sudden craving for a sandwich and brought to you by a developer who clearly had too much caffeine on their hands. Specializing in elegant solutions to problems that don't exist, this project is a testament to what can be achieved with a little bit of code and a whole lot of "why not?".
